# Machine Learning Projects – Break Through Tech AI Program

This repository contains a series of machine learning projects completed as part of the Break Through Tech AI Program with MIT and Cornell Tech. I was one of the 100 students selected from a pool of over 3,000 applicants for this intensive applied AI program.

Each notebook explores core machine learning methods and model selection strategies using real-world datasets.

## Project Overview

### ComparingRegressionModels.ipynb
- Compared Linear Regression and Decision Trees for regression tasks.
- Explored how ensemble methods can improve performance by reducing variance and bias.

### GBDT.ipynb
- Implemented Gradient Boosted Decision Trees for regression.
- Discussed how boosting differs from bagging and its impact on overfitting.

### ImplementCNN.ipynb
- Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on image classification.
- Used the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition.

### ModelSelectionForKNN.ipynb
- Demonstrated model selection for K-Nearest Neighbors.
- Tuned hyperparameters and evaluated accuracy using cross-validation.

### ModelSelectionForLogisticRegression.ipynb
- Focused on selecting regularization parameters and evaluating logistic regression on classification tasks.

### RandomForest.ipynb
- Built and evaluated a Random Forest model for bagging-based ensemble learning.
- Compared against single decision tree performance.

## Life Expectancy Prediction (Final Project)

### Week9DefineAndSolveMLProblem.ipynb  
### WHR2018Chapter2OnlineData.csv

This was my final independent project in the program. I developed a model to predict life expectancy based on features from the World Happiness Report.

- Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset, removed irrelevant or redundant features, and handled missing values.
- Feature Engineering: Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables and normalized numerical inputs.
- Modeling: Trained and evaluated multiple regression models, including Linear Regression and ensemble methods.
- Results: Demonstrated how socio-economic and psychological indicators (like GDP per capita, social support, and perceived corruption) can be quantitatively linked to life expectancy.

This project brought together all of the core skills I learned during the program — from data cleaning and feature selection to model building and evaluation — and was a strong example of applying ML to a real-world global health question.

## Dataset

- WHR2018Chapter2OnlineData.csv: Original dataset from the World Happiness Report (2018), used for the life expectancy project.

## Notes

- All notebooks were developed in Python using libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
- Each project highlights a different concept or technique in machine learning, ranging from simple models to more complex ensemble and deep learning approaches.

## Program Info

These projects were completed through the Break Through Tech AI Program, a semester-long initiative led by MIT and Cornell Tech focused on giving students hands-on experience in AI through project-based learning and industry mentorship.
